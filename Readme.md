# Gymtracker

A simple web app to track exercises on your phone in the gym.

The frontend uses the React-like [dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/) framework with client-side rendering.

The backend uses [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) for the web server and [sea-orm](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm) for interacting with the database.

# Features

- Submit exercises using weights or bodyweight.
- History view shows for recently submitted exercises.
- PR view shows top 3 weight/rep combinations per exercise.
- Graph view shows an overview of your development over time.
- User view allows tracking of body composition data (weight, muscle mass, etc.) and user pictures for social featuresâ„¢ that will probably never exist.
- At the moment very limited admininstration to clean up autogenerated exercises.


# Deployment

Using the `docker-compose.yml` it's very easy to setup.
Just adapt the provided `.docker.env` template.

(Do not forget to change the password in the DB connection URL. And keep in mind that some older docker versions use quotation marks in an .env file literally in the value.)

The file `gt-frontend/dist/config.js` can be used to overwrite configuration in the frontend without rebuilding the image. Mount a modifed copy over the path using docker.
